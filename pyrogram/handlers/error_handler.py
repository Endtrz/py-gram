class ErrorHandler(Handler):
    """The Error handler class. Used to handle errors.
    It is intended to be used with :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.add_handler`

    For a nicer way to register this handler, have a look at the
    :meth:`~pyrogram.Client.on_message` decorator.

    Parameters:
        callback (``Callable``):
            Pass a function that will be called when a new Error arrives. It takes *(client, error)*
            as positional arguments (look at the section below for a detailed description).

        errors (:obj:`Exception` | List of :obj:`Exception`):
            Pass one or more exception classes to allow only a subset of errors to be passed
            in your callback function.

    Other parameters:
        client (:obj:`~pyrogram.Client`):
            The Client itself, useful when you want to call other API methods inside the message handler.

        error (:obj:`~Exception`):
            The error that was raised.

        update (:obj:`~pyrogram.Update`):
            The update that caused the error.
